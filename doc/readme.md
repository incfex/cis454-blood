For this app, the normal users(donors and requesters) will use mobile phone to use this app(using android studio to write it), administrater will use website to manage user information(which is easier for administrater). Therefore, our project has mobile app for normal users and website for administraters.

To visit website, you can go to frontend-admin directory and open the login.html file; to login with administrater account, enter username "admin" with password "1", then you can login successfully and manage user information.

To use mobile app, out project make it be apk, so you just install the apk and use that directly.
